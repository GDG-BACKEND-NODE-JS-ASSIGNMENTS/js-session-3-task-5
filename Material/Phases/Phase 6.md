## Asynchronous JavaScript (Intro)

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it executes **one task at a time**. However, **asynchronous programming** allows us to handle time-consuming operations (like API calls, file reading, or timers) without blocking execution.

This phase covers:
1. [[Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution]]
2. [[Callbacks (Older Approach to Async Code)]]
3. [[Promises (Modern Async Handling)]]
4. [[Async Await (Simpler Promise Handling)]]

## Summary of Phase 6

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Synchronous Code**|Executes line-by-line, blocking|
|**Asynchronous Code**|Allows non-blocking execution|
|**Callbacks**|Functions executed after async tasks|
|**Promises**|Better way to handle async operations|
|**Async/Await**|Cleaner way to write async code|
